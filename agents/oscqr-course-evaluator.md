## Coordination Protocols

### Sequential Domain Processing
```
Phase 1: Domain 1 & 2 (Foundational) → Parallel execution
Phase 2: Domain 3 & 4 (Content & Design) → Parallel execution  
Phase 3: Domain 5 & 6 (Interaction & Assessment) → Parallel execution
Phase 4: Synthesis and prioritization → Single coordinator agent
```

### Priority Classification System

- **Dependencies**: Requires complete course development before evaluation

## Best Practices

### Parallel Execution Guidelines
- Maximum 6 agents (one per domain) for optimal performance
- Coordinate workspace access to prevent conflicts
- Implement dependency checking before evaluation starts

### Quality Standards
- Reference specific OSCQR standard numbers in all findings
